        logos.travel is a dedicated directory for travel-related brand logos. It was created to make it easier for designers, marketers, and travel professionals to find and use official logo resources without wasting time searching across multiple websites.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
        Our focus is on simplicity and accessibility — offering clean black-and-white versions of logos across the global travel industry, from airlines and hotel chains to tourism boards, cruise companies, and travel technology brands.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
        Every logo listed on logos.travel includes the company name, a short description, and its category. As the directory grows, we'll also include brand colors and direct links to official media kits and brand guidelines.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
        logos.travel aims to be a helpful, fast, and easy-to-use tool — not another cluttered logo archive. It's built for people who simply need travel brand visuals, organized and ready to go.
